            Period-4 App Development with React Native
            Note: This description is too big for a single exam-question. It will be divided up into separate questions for the exam
            Explain the concept of the 1-2-3  problem (you need to check the slides for this phrase)
            Explain some of the benefits App-development gets by using JavaScript
            Explain the topics React, React Native and Expo and how they are connected
            Explain the concept of "Write Once, Run anywhere" and "Learn once, Use Anywhere"
            Explain the Pros & Cons of using Hybrid/HTML5 - Mobile App apps compared to Native apps
            Demonstrate, with a live example + code, how we interact with features like camera, location, ImagePicker, video and more with React Native and Expo
            Demonstrate, using a live example, how we can debug a React Native App, without the need to install either XCode or the Android SDK.
            Explain, using a working Example, the basic building blocks in a React Native/Expo application
            Demonstrate using a working example, how a React Native/Expo app can communicate with a backend. Also, either demonstrate or explain, how we can expose our localhost servers to “the outside world” while we are developing.
            Mini Project
            Depending on which mini-project you decided for these are the learning goals/questions
            Friend-finder
            ·         Demonstrate the application (on a real mobile device) and explain shortly about its purpose
            ·         Briefly explain about the Mongo-indexes used on the backend (TTL, 2d)
            ·         Explain the JavaScript code that implements the REST-API(s) used by the Client
            ·         Explain the Client components in the order of where they are imported from:
            o   React-native
            o   Expo
            
            Graph QL with React Native
            ·         Demonstrate the application (on a real mobile device) and explain shortly about its purpose
            ·         Explain and demonstrate the backend model implemented by Graphcool
            ·         Explain shortly about GraphQL (max 3-4 minutes) and how it differs from a traditional REST API
            ·         Explain the Client components in the order of where they are imported from:
            o   React-native
            o   Expo
            ·         Explain the Client Code which communicates with the Graphcool backend
            Your own idea
            If you got your own idea approved, you also got the learning goals approved. These are what we will talk about for this mini-project
