            Note: This description is too big for a single exam-question. It will be divided up into separate questions for the exam
            Explain about promises in ES 6 including, the problems they solve, a quick explanation of the Promise API and:
            ●	Example(s) that demonstrate how to avoid the callback hell  (“Pyramid of Doom")
            ●	Example(s) that demonstrate how to execute asynchronous code in serial or parallel
            ●	Example(s) that demonstrate how to implement our own promise-solutions.
            ●	Example(s) that demonstrate error handling with promises
            
            Explain about JavaScripts async/await, how it relates to promises and reasons to use it compared to the plain promise API.
            
            Provide examples to demonstrate 
            Why this often is the preferred way of handling promises
            Error handling with async/await
            Serial or parallel execution with async/await.
            
            
            Explain the concept of state in relation to programming generally, web-applications and React
            
            Explain about  “plain state handling” in React using Props and State
            
            Explain about MobX, and Redux and why/when such libraries makes sense.
            
            Explain, using a simple example how to use Redux. Include the following concepts:
            ●	Immuatbility
            ●	Single source of truth
            ●	Actions and Reducers
            ●	How to use Redux with React
            
            Explain and demonstrate tools to debug Redux applications, including the concept Time Traveling
